# AirportsDistance
REST service to measure distance in miles between two airports. Airports are identified by 3-letter IATA code. 

The simplest method of calculating distance relies on some advanced-looking math.  Known as the Haversine formula, it uses spherical trigonometry to determine the great circle distance between two points. Wikipedia has more on the formulation of this popular straight line distance approximation.
